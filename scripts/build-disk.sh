# Turn the container image into a bootable ISO or VM disk, on your own machine.
# Needs podman and sudo; the builder must run privileged.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-disk.sh                    # ISO from localhost/terrene:latest
#   ./scripts/build-disk.sh qcow2              # VM disk instead
#   ./scripts/build-disk.sh iso terrene v2     # a specific image and tag
#   ./scripts/build-disk.sh --check qcow2      # check the config, build nothing
#
# The tag picks which local image goes onto the ISO. What the installed machine
# upgrades from afterwards is set by the kickstart in disk_config/iso.toml, and
# that names the published image at :latest whatever is built here - which is
# the only reason an ISO built from localhost/... installs a machine that can
# upgrade at all.
#
# --check stops after the checks below - the config file it would use, and the
# placeholder-password refusal - and reports what it found. Useful for asking
# "would this build?" without waiting for one, and it is what the tests use:
# they exercise the refusal, and running the real thing would launch a
# privileged builder on every case that is meant to pass.
#
# Results land in ./output/
